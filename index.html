              <p>You have two types of opportunities to provide feedback and I hope you use both of them.</p>
              <p>At the close of each section, there is a text box for you to enter your feedback about the questions in that particular section. Once you have completed the questionnaire and reviewed your results, you will be directed to answer 11 questions about the survey.</p>

              <p>I eagerly welcome your critique. I am committed to refining this tool and making it as useful for parents as possible. I want this tool to be a resource for caregivers, EI providers, and other professionals in the field.</p>

              <h2 id="intro">Welcome to the Autism Transition Tool</h2>
              <p>As our children grow and age, there will be many transitions. Ending Early Intervention (EI) services is the first of many of these types of changes that we, as parents and guardians, must weather.</p>
              <p>The purpose of this tool is to empower you in building a greater vision of the services, supports, and community-based programs that will help sustain your family as you all grow and age.</p>
          
              <p>The following questions are designed to help you assess what services you are receiving in EI and what services you are looking forward to once your child ages out of EI. Once you have completed all the questions, you will be directed to a final page that includes your answers and resources that may be helpful.</p>

                    <p class="sophia-hates-music">For the purposes of this table, the amount of music therapy you have received in Early Intervention and the amount you will receive in the future are not taken into account.</p>

                    <p class="no-iep">At this time, it’s difficult to assess what services and supports will look like for your child once you transition out of Early Intervention. You might want to revisit this tool when you have a better understanding of what might be included in your child’s IEP.</p>
                    <p class="no-iep">If you’re eager to take some action at this time, you might consider scouting potential providers who might be a good fit for your family. Sometimes school districts don’t offer the amount of services necessary for children to maintain the same rate of progress they achieved in Early Intervention. While this is frustrating and problematic, insurance benefits usually cover services with private providers.</p>

                    <p class="decreasing">Once you transition out of Early Intervention, your child will be receiving less supports and services than they did when they were in Early Intervention. You can use the table to identify exactly where the amount of their services will decrease.</p>
                    <p class="decreasing">If this is a purposeful decision, then it might be important to discuss with your service coordinator how to monitor your child’s rate of progress to ensure that they continue to gain skills at the rate they did in Early Intervention.</p>
                    <p class="decreasing">If this isn’t a purposeful decision, you have a couple options available to you. You can pursue additional services privately through your health insurance benefits, or you can explore your options with modifying your child’s IEP so that they receive more services, or you can do both.</p>
                    <p class="decreasing">If you’d like more information about the IEP process or on working with the school district on modifying your child’s IEP, you can contact the Federation for Children with Special Needs at (617) 236-7210 or (800) 331-0688 (in MA only) or take a look at their <a href="http://fcsn.org">website</a>. The Federation for Children with Special Needs also hosts free workshops focusing on your child’s educational rights at different locations across the state. To learn more about those workshops, you can view more information <a href="http://fcsn.org/pti/workshops/home.php#schedule">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>You're satisfied with the amount and quality of your EI services - that’s wonderful! It might be helpful going forward if you work with your service coordinator to identify what about the amount and quality of services is satisfying for you. This will help you appraise providers in the future.

              <li class="yes"><p>If you've spoken with your service coordinator about your dissatisfaction with the services that your child is receiving and have also spoken with your service coordinator's supervisor, then it's likely that you have exhausted your options for your EI services. If you have identified and began to work with providers outside the EI system that you are satisfied with, then you are well on your way to building an effective team for your child once they have aged out of EI.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="no"><p>If you've spoken with your service coordinator about your dissatisfaction with your child's services, and have also spoken with your service coordionator's supervisor, then you might want to explore options to work with providers outside of the Early Intervention system. Identifying providers that accept your health insurance is among the first steps to building an effective care team that will help you sustain your child's outcomes once you transition out of Early Intervention.</p></li>

                    </ul>

                    <p class="could-improve">Your child is expected to receive the same amount of services and supports once you transition out of Early Intervention. This improves the likelihood that your son or daughter will maintain the same rate of progress that they achieved in Early Intervention. If you would like to see your child’s rate of progress improve, you could discuss the areas where your child has the greatest challenges. You might also consult your team of providers outside of Early Intervention to see if anyone is interested in seeing a greater rate of progress in a particular area.</p>
                    <p class="could-improve">It is often true that many families of children with autism are overwhelmed by the amount of services and supports they receive, as well as the demands of a rigorous schedule of interventions. If you find that your schedule is taxing, it might be good to revisit increasing services at a time when you’re less overwhelmed. - Or you might never feel the need to consider increasing services and supports for your child. The latter decision is perfectly acceptable.</p>

                    <p class="huzzah">It appears that your child will be receiving more services and supports when you transition out of Early Intervention. If you did this purposefully, then you’ve done an excellent job accessing all the resources that are available to you.</p>
                    <p class="huzzah">It might be helpful to review where your child will see an increase in services with your service coordinator and your child’s specialists. It’s important to make sure that all areas of your child’s needs are addressed. Sometimes we, as parents or guardians, might focus on one particular area where our child or children are delayed at the expense of supporting another area of his, her, or their development. Regardless, it’s clear that you are actively seeking out the resources available to support your child’s progress.</p>

                    <p class="iep-dont-know">If you are less than six months away from your transition out of Early Intervention, you might want to check with your service coordinator about whether or not they have notified the district of your child. You can also call your school district and speak with someone from the intake team to discuss referring your child for special education evaluations and services. To learn more about Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and the IEP process, you can consult the Federation for Children with Special Needs at (617) 236-7210 or (800) 331-0688 (in MA only) or take a look at their <a href=”http://fcsn.org”>website</a>.

                    <h3>Medical Specialists</h3>

                    <p>It appears that the following providers will make up your child’s care team once you leave Early Intervention.</p>

                    <ul data-aggregate="medical-specialists">
                    </ul>

                    <p>These providers know you, your child, and your family. They can provide valuable support once you transition out of Early Intervention. These same specialists can also advocate on your child’s behalf if any changes are needed to your child’s IEP.</p>

                    <p>It might be helpful to review this list of providers with your service coordinator and discuss whether or not any type of specialist is missing. While all the above providers and specialists are concerned and dedicated to your child’s development, there might be one or two in particular that you find focuses the most on a larger picture of what supports and services your child needs. It might be helpful to also review this list with them and hear their recommendations of whether or not you should add specialists to this team.</p>

                      <p class="wic-not-snap">Your participation in the WIC program is based on your income and shouldn’t end when EI ends. WIC will end when your child turns 5, or it will end if you no longer qualify based on your income. If you haven’t yet applied for SNAP, or food stamps, you might want to consider doing so because you may also qualify for this program. You can speak with your service coordinator about applying for SNAP and you can also get more information on their <a href=”http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/”>website</a>.</p>

                      <p class="snap-not-wic">Your participation in SNAP is based on your income and shouldn’t end when EI ends. SNAP will end if you no longer qualify based on your income, or if you fail to reapply for SNAP benefits each year. If you are eligible for SNAP, you are also likely eligible for WIC. If you haven’t applied for WIC, you might want to consider doing so. You can ask your service coordinator about applying for WIC and also get more information on their <a href=”http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/howtoapply/”>website</a>.</p>

                      <p class="wic-and-snap">Your participation in WIC and SNAP are based on your income and shouldn’t end when EI does. You can speak with your service coordinator, your local WIC office, or the DTA worker who oversees your SNAP benefits.</p>

                      <p class="no-toys">It appears that your assistance with securing books, toys, and/or clothing will end when your services from EI end. It is important to speak with your service coordinator about how to fill this upcoming gap. If your service coordinator can’t offer you any suggestions, then it’s important to bring this up with the intake team in your school district or with the Team Facilitator. The school team should know who in the district may be able to help you secure this type of support.</p>

                      <p class="no-dds">All families with children who have been diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder should consider applying to the Autism Division of the Department of Developmental Services (DDS). Some families may also be eligible for services from DDS, in addition to being eligible to the Autism Division. You can ask your service coordinator more about what this may mean for you and your child.</p>
                      <p class="no-dds">If you are interested in applying to the Autism Division of DDS, you can access the application <a href=”http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dmr/awp/eligibility-application-autism-division-only.pdf”>here</a>.

                      <p class="no-supports-parents-groups">It appears that you don’t participate in any community-based programs that focus on supporting parents and guardians. You might want to consider seeking out this type of support. Raising a child or children on the autism spectrum is challenging, stressful, difficult, and also uniquely rewarding. It’s important to connect with others who are familiar with what you are experiencing.</p>
                      <p class="no-supports-parents-groups"> On the other hand, you might find that you currently have enough emotional support because people in your circle of friends or family understand what you are going through. If you find yourself burning out or getting extremely overwhelmed, you might want to research some potential support or parent groups, as well as a parent to parent match.</p>
                      <p class="no-supports-parents-groups">If you are interested in researching support groups and parents groups, or learning about the Parent-to-Parent program of Family TIES, you can explore the website <a href=”http://massfamilyties.org/p2p/p2p.php”>here</a>,</p>

                      <p class="supports-parents-groups">It appears that you have connected with other parents and guardians through either community-based programs or through organizations like <a href=”http://www.massfamilyties.org/”>Family TIES</a> or <a href=”http://www.tillinc.org/autism_training.html”>TILL</a>. It will be important to sustain connections like these. Some parents go to support groups or have a parent to parent connection for a short period of time and then decide to stop. It’s sometimes important to give yourself a break. Now that you know where to find these types of supports, it is likely you will be able to find them again in the future if you need to.</p> 


                      <p class="rec-program">It appears that you have identified a recreation program for your child. This is a great way for your child to connect with a community of his or her peers. It will also be important for you to sustain this connection as your child ages. Once the program directors and program staff are familiar with your child, they will likely know and understand ways to support your child in his or her recreation program.”</p>

                      <p class="no-rec-program">It appears that you are not currently connected with any recreation programs. Recreational programs are opportunities for your child to connect with other children and experience different types of physical activity (regardless of their gross motor abilities or impairments). Whether it’s swimming, yoga, team sports, or “open gym,” recreational programs can offer a lot of great opportunities for structured or unstructured activities that further support your child’s development.</p>
                      <p class="no-rec-program">Many towns have recreation departments that serve residents of the town. The YMCA is also a great option for exploring potential recreational opportunities. If neither of these exist close to you, you can talk with your service coordinator about potential options for your child.</p>

                      <p class="no-religious">Our connections to our respective religious communities can provide us with the spiritual sustenance necessary to maintain resiliency throughout the sometimes devastating experience of raising a child or children with a significant developmental disability like autism. This is an incredibly important connection.</p>
                      <p class="religious">One of the hardest things about our religious communities can sometimes be the religious education experiences that our children have. When they are young and there are less expectations of them, it can be easy to assume that the inclusivity of the community will persist. Or, if your religious community does not openly embrace children with disabilities, then perhaps you are not having a positive experience. Nonetheless, things can change for the better, or things can take a turn for the worse.</p>
                      <p class="religious">You might want to consider thinking about how to either continue to make the religious education experience in your religious community a positive one for your child, or how to improve it. Chances are that you are not the first person to have a child with disabilities. Your courage in advocating for your child to meaningfully participate in religious activities could pave the way for many more children to be included in the future.</p>
