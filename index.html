You can discuss potential providers with your Service Coordinator or the specialist who focuses most on your child’s behavioral development (this might be a developmental pediatrician or neurologist). Once you have identified potential providers, it is important to confirm that they will accept your health insurance and begin the process of securing services for your child.

                    <p class="no-iep">Because you haven't yet seen a draft of your child's IEP, it's difficult to assess what services and supports will look like for your child once you transition out of Early Intervention. You might want to revisit this tool when you have a better understanding of what might be included in your child’s IEP.</p>
                    <p class="no-iep">If you’re eager to take some action at this time, you might consider scouting potential providers who might be good additions to your team of specialists. Sometimes school districts don’t offer the amount of services necessary for children to maintain the same rate of progress they achieved in Early Intervention. While this is frustrating and problematic, insurance benefits usually cover services with private providers. It might be helpful to begin identifying therapists who would be able to work with your child once EI ends.</p>

                    <p class="decreasing">Once you transition out of Early Intervention, your child will be receiving less supports and services than they did when they were in Early Intervention. You can use the table to identify exactly where the amount of their services will decrease.</p>
                    <p class="decreasing">If this is a purposeful decision, then it might be important to discuss with your service coordinator how to monitor your child’s rate of progress to ensure that they continue to gain skills at the rate they did in Early Intervention.</p>
                    <p class="decreasing">If this isn’t a purposeful decision, you have a couple options available to you. You can pursue additional services privately through your health insurance benefits, or you can explore your options with modifying your child’s IEP so that they receive more services, or you can do both.</p>
                    <p class="decreasing">If you’d like more information about the IEP process or on working with the school district on modifying your child’s IEP, you can contact the <a href="http://fcsn.org">Federation for Children with Special Needs</a> at (617) 236-7210 or (800) 331-0688 (in MA only)..

                    <p class="less-aba">It appears that once your child transitions out of EI that he or she will be receiving less hours of ABA services. Sometimes this occurs because a child is enrolled in a school program that doesn’t allow for the amount of ABA to continue. It might be helpful to look at the number of hours your child is in school each week, add that to the number of hours of in-home ABA you expect to receive after EI, and then discuss with your service coordinator whether or not your child will be receiving comparable interventions.</p>

                    <p class="no-future-aba">It appears that your child will no longer be receiving ABA services once he or she transitions out of EI. If you are interested in continuing ABA services in your home once EI ends, you can speak with your service coordinator about using your insurance benefits to access ABA under ARICA.</p><p> However, it’s also possible that you no longer want to continue receiving ABA services in your home after EI ends. This is certainly your choice and you know what’s best for your child. However, you might want to consider discussing this with your service coordinator and some of the specialists on your child’s medical team.

                    <p class="could-improve">Your child is expected to receive the same amount of services and supports once you transition out of EI. This improves the likelihood that your son or daughter will maintain the same rate of progress that they achieved in Early Intervention. If you would like to see your child’s rate of progress improve, you could focus on the areas where your child has the greatest challenges. You might also consult your team of providers outside of EI to see if anyone is interested in seeing a greater rate of progress in a particular area.</p>
                    <p class="could-improve">However, it is often true that many families of children with autism are overwhelmed by the amount of services and supports they receive, as well as the demands of a rigorous schedule of interventions. If you find that your schedule is taxing, it might be good to revisit increasing services at a time when you’re less overwhelmed. - Or you might never feel the need to consider increasing services and supports for your child. The latter decision is perfectly acceptable.</p>

                    <p class="huzzah">It appears that your child will be receiving more services and supports when you transition out of EI. If you did this purposefully, then you’ve done an excellent job accessing all the resources that are available to you.</p>
                    <p class="huzzah">It might be helpful to review where your child will see an increase in services with your service coordinator and your child’s specialists. It’s important to make sure that all areas of your child’s needs are addressed. Sometimes we, as parents or guardians, might focus on one particular area where our child is delayed at the expense of supporting another area his or her development. Regardless, it’s clear that you are actively seeking out the resources available to support your child’s progress.</p>

                    <p class="iep-dont-know">If you are less than six months away from your transition out of Early Intervention, you might want to check with your service coordinator about whether or not they have notified the district about your child's involvement with EI. You can also call your school district and speak with someone from the intake team to refer your child for special education evaluations and services. To learn more about Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and the IEP process, you can consult the <a href="http://fcsn.org">Federation for Children with Special Needs</a> at (617) 236-7210 or (800) 331-0688 (in MA only). The Federation for Children with Special Needs also hosts <a href="http://fcsn.org/pti/workshops/home.php#schedule">free workshops</a> at different locations across the state that discuss your child’s educational rights.</p>

                    <h3>Medical Specialists</h3>

                    <p>It appears that the following providers will make up your child’s care team once you leave Early Intervention.</p>

                    <ul data-aggregate="medical-specialists">
                    </ul>

                    <p>These providers know you, your child, and your family. They can provide valuable support once you transition out of EI. These same specialists can also advocate on your child’s behalf if any changes are needed to your child’s IEP.</p>

                    <p>It might be helpful to review this list of providers with your service coordinator and discuss whether or not any type of specialist is missing. While all the above providers and specialists are concerned and dedicated to your child’s development, there might be one or two that focuses the most on a larger picture of what supports and services your child needs. It might be helpful to also review this list with them and hear their recommendations of whether or not you should add specialists to this team.</p>

                    <div class="text-results">
                      <p class="wic-not-snap">Your participation in the WIC program is based on your income and shouldn’t end when EI ends. WIC will end when your child turns 5, or it will end if you no longer qualify based on your income. If you haven’t yet applied for SNAP, or food stamps, you might want to consider doing so because you may also qualify for this program. You can speak with your service coordinator about applying for SNAP and you can also get more information on their <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/">website</a>.</p>

                      <p class="snap-not-wic">Your participation in SNAP is based on your income and shouldn’t end when EI ends. SNAP will end if you no longer qualify based on your income, or if you fail to reapply for SNAP benefits each year. If you are eligible for SNAP, you are also likely eligible for WIC. If you haven’t applied for WIC, you might want to consider doing so. You can ask your service coordinator about applying for WIC and also get more information on their <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/howtoapply/">website</a>.</p>

                      <p class="wic-and-snap">Your participation in WIC and SNAP are based on your income and shouldn’t end when EI does. You can speak with your service coordinator, your local WIC office, or the DTA worker who oversees your SNAP benefits.</p>

                      <p class="no-toys">It appears that your assistance with securing books, toys, and/or clothing for your child will end when your services from EI end. It is important to speak with your service coordinator about how to fill this upcoming gap. If your service coordinator can’t offer you any suggestions, then it’s important to bring this up with the intake team in your school district or with the Team Facilitator. The school team should know who in the district may be able to help you secure this type of support.</p>

                      <p class="no-dds">All families with children who have been diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder should consider applying to the Autism Division of the Department of Developmental Services (DDS). Some families may also be eligible for services from DDS, in addition to being eligible to the Autism Division. You can ask your service coordinator more about what this may mean for you and your child.</p>
                      <p class="no-dds">If you are interested in applying to the Autism Division of DDS, you can access the application <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dmr/awp/eligibility-application-autism-division-only.pdf">here</a>.

                      <p class="no-masshealth">If you haven't yet applied for MassHealth, you might want to consider doing so. All children with an ASD diagnosis should qualify for MassHealth. If your child is currently covered by a different insurance provider, then your child would keep that health insurance as their primary health insurance and MassHealth would become their secondary health insurance. MassHealth would cover co-pays at certain facilities were MassHealth is accepted. To learn about how to sign up for MassHealth, you can visit <a href="http://www.massresources.org/masshealth-apply.html">MassResources.org</a>.</p>

                      <p class="no-ssi-but-cash">If you are currently receiving cash assistance through the Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) and you have not yet applied for <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10029.pdf">Social Security disability benefits</a> for your child, then you might want to consider doing so. Your child is likely eligible for Social Security disability benefits because they are on the autism spectrum. Disability benefits are another source of income that can help you support your family.</p>
            
                      <p class="no-ssi-no-cash-but-wic-or-snap">If you are receiving food assistance from either SNAP or WIC (or both) and you haven't yet applied for <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10029.pdf">Social Security disability benefits</a> for your child, you might want to consider doing so.

                      <p class="no-supports-parents-groups">It appears that you don’t participate in any community-based programs that focus on supporting parents and guardians. You might want to consider seeking out this type of support. Raising a child or children on the autism spectrum is challenging, stressful, difficult, and also uniquely rewarding. It’s important to connect with others who are familiar with what you are experiencing.</p>
                      <p class="no-supports-parents-groups"> On the other hand, you might find that you currently have enough emotional support because people in your circle of friends or family understand what you are going through. If you find yourself burning out or getting extremely overwhelmed, you might want to research some potential support or parent groups, as well as a parent to parent match.</p>
                      <p class="no-supports-parents-groups">If you are interested in researching support groups and parents groups, or learning about the Parent-to-Parent program of Family TIES, you can explore the website <a href="http://massfamilyties.org/p2p/p2p.php">here</a>,</p>

                      <p class="supports-parents-groups">It appears that you have connected with other parents and guardians through either community-based programs or through organizations like <a href="http://www.massfamilyties.org/">Family TIES</a> or <a href="http://www.tillinc.org/autism_training.html">TILL</a>. It will be important to sustain connections like these. Some parents go to support groups or have a parent to parent connection for a short period of time and then decide to stop. It’s sometimes important to give yourself a break. Now that you know where to find these types of supports, it is likely you will be able to find them again in the future if you need to.</p> 


                      <p class="rec-program">It appears that you have identified a recreation program for your child. This is a great way for your child to connect with a community of his or her peers. It will also be important for you to sustain this connection as your child ages. Once the program directors and program staff are familiar with your child, they will likely know and understand ways to support your child in his or her recreation program.”</p>

                      <p class="no-rec-program">It appears that you are not currently connected with any recreation programs. Recreational programs are opportunities for your child to connect with other children and experience different types of physical activity (regardless of their gross motor abilities or impairments). Whether it’s swimming, yoga, team sports, or “open gym,” recreational programs can offer a lot of great opportunities for structured or unstructured activities that further support your child’s development.</p>
                      <p class="no-rec-program">Many towns have recreation departments that serve residents of the town. The YMCA is also a great option for exploring potential recreational opportunities. If neither of these exist close to you, you can talk with your service coordinator about potential options for your child.</p>

                      <p class="no-religious">Our connections to our respective religious communities can provide us with the spiritual sustenance necessary to maintain resiliency throughout the sometimes devastating experience of raising a child or children with a significant developmental disability like autism. This is an incredibly important connection.</p>
                      <p class="religious">One of the hardest things about our religious communities can sometimes be the religious education experiences that our children have. When they are young and there are less expectations of them, it can be easy to assume that the inclusivity of the community will persist. Or, if your religious community does not openly embrace children with disabilities, then perhaps you are not having a positive experience. Nonetheless, things can change for the better, or things can take a turn for the worse.</p>
                      <p class="religious">You might want to consider thinking about how to either continue to make the religious education experience in your religious community a positive one for your child, or how to improve it. Chances are that you are not the first person to have a child with disabilities. Your courage in advocating for your child to meaningfully participate in religious activities could pave the way for many more children to be included in the future.</p>
