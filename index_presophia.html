            <p>I understand that you may not have a child or children with autism and I also am aware that your child may have aged out of EI long ago. Please proceed through the questionnaire as best you can. Once the questionnaire is completed, you will receive results and resources relevant to the answers you provided. Following those results, you will be directed to provide feedback based on your experience.</p>
            <p>I encourage you to keep an open, but critical mind. I am eager to refine this tool so that is effective, easy to use, and empowers caregivers instead of being overwhelming.</p>
            <p>You are welcome to test this survey numerous times if you’d like to see how different results arise based on different answers.</p>

              <p>As our children grow and age, there will be many transitions. Ending Early Intervention services is the first of many of these types of changes that we, as caregivers, must weather. This tool is designed to empower you as you enter, proceed through, and complete this process.</p>
              <p>The purpose of this tool is to empower you to build a greater vision of the services, supports, and community-based programs that will help sustain your family as you all grow and age.</p>
              <p>This tool is specifically designed for caregivers of children on the autism spectrum, although parents of children with other diagnoses might find it helpful, too.</p>
              <p><strong>At the end of this survey, this survey and resources can be printed out. - unless there’s a good descriptor, it’ll be complicated for users to understand what im trying to do; define target audience.</strong></p>

It also reflects positively on you that you have sought out private providers to further support the interventions that your child is already receiving.

                          Answers for “E” are recorded somehow so that I can later modify this part of the survey based on these.

                          If “no” on A, B, or C: “Connecting with other parents is extremely important. Caring for a child with [special needs/autism] can be isolating, lonely, and frustrating. It’s important to provide yourself with an emotional outlet so that you don’t feel alone and can get support around the challenges that you face. To learn more about support groups and parent groups, you can contact xyz. You can contact Family TIES if you are interested in the P2P program.”

                          If “no” on D: “The local recreation department may offer programs for children the same age as your child. Sometimes the prospects of having your child participate in these activities can be daunting. Truthfully, some town recreation departments are better at integrating and supporting children with special needs than others. If you’re concerned about the recreation department in your area, there are sometimes other options. Organizations like the YMCA offer recreation opportunities for children with all types of abilities and disabilities. If you do a little research, it’s likely that you’ll be able to identify a great organization that can offer excellent recreational options for your child or all of your children.
