          <h3>About</h3>
		  <br />
		  <p><em>I undertook the task of creating the <strong>"Almost 3" Autism Transition Tool</strong> as a response to my own family's experience transitioning out of Early Intervention. I had a hard time adjusting to life after EI because I had no way of envisioning what our future -- or, our "now" -- would look like. </em></p>
		  <p><em>This resource was originally based on, "Starting Points for Service Coordinators for Children with Hearing Loss." The pursuit of this project was inspired by my EI Social Worker, a pretty amazing woman that helped me survive that first year after my child's diagnosis. She suggested I create a tool like this one and I'm so glad that she did.</em></p>
		  <p><em>This project is the outcome of my participation in the Early Intervention Parent Leadership Project's Family Leadership Training Series funded by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. I created this tool with the guidance, help, and support of the training's facilitators and my fellow participants. I also received significant input from other caregivers and professionals in the field.</em></p>
		  <p><em>I look forward to further refining this tool with additional input and support from more caregivers and professionals in the field. I welcome your feedback and would love to hear from you. You can reach me at sophia@AutismTransitionTools.org.</em></p>
		  <br />
		  <p><em>Best,</em></p>
