            <p>Presumably you have agreed to be a tester because you have some experience with Early Intervention, as well as children with special needs and their caregivers.</p>
            <p>Please proceed through this questionnaire as best you can. Once you have completed each section, you will receive results and resources based on the answers you provided.</p>
            <p>You have two types of opportunities to provide feedback and I hope you use both of them.</p>
			<p>At the close of each section, there is a text box for you to enter your feedback about the questions in that section. Once you have completed the questionnaire and reviewed your results, you will be directed to answer 10 questions about the survey.</p>
			<p>You are welcome to test this survey multiple times if you'd like to see how different results arise based on different answers.</p>
			<p>I eagerly welcome your critique. I am committed to refining this tool and making it as useful for parents as possible. I want this tool to be a resource for caregivers, EI providers, and other professionals in the field.</p>

              <p>As our children grow and age, there will be many transitions. Ending Early Intervention services is the first of many of these types of changes that we, as caregivers, must weather. This tool is designed to empower you as you enter, proceed through, and complete this process.</p>
              <p>The purpose of this tool is to empower you in building a greater vision of the services, supports, and community-based programs that will help sustain your family as you all grow and age.</p>
              <p>This tool is specifically designed for caregivers of children on the autism spectrum, although parents of children with other diagnoses might find it helpful, too.</p>
              <p>The following questions are designed to help you assess what services you are receiving Early Intervention and what services you are looking forward to once your child ages out. Once you have completed all the questions, you will be directed to a final page with your answers and resources that may be helpful to you. You will have the option to print this information. You are welcome to use this tool as many times as you would like.</p>

                          Answers for “E” are recorded somehow so that I can later modify this part of the survey based on these.

                          If “no” on A, B, or C: “Connecting with other parents is extremely important. Caring for a child with [special needs/autism] can be isolating, lonely, and frustrating. It’s important to provide yourself with an emotional outlet so that you don’t feel alone and can get support around the challenges that you face. To learn more about support groups and parent groups, you can contact xyz. You can contact Family TIES if you are interested in the P2P program.”

                          If “no” on D: “The local recreation department may offer programs for children the same age as your child. Sometimes the prospects of having your child participate in these activities can be daunting. Truthfully, some town recreation departments are better at integrating and supporting children with special needs than others. If you’re concerned about the recreation department in your area, there are sometimes other options. Organizations like the YMCA offer recreation opportunities for children with all types of abilities and disabilities. If you do a little research, it’s likely that you’ll be able to identify a great organization that can offer excellent recreational options for your child or all of your children.

                          If “yes” on A, B, or C:
